# Angular Webpack Boilerplate

This project can be either built by `angular-cli` or `webpack`. When building using `angular-cli`, not all scss files will be processed properly. But the most significant advantage of this, compared to other similar projects which may already be removed or no longer maintained, is that this contains dependencies up-to-date in 2022.
